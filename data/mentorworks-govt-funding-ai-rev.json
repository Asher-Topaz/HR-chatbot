It is evident once again that a lack of adequate information is available for women, especially related to small business financing options. Many female entrepreneurs continue facing several challenges with keeping their staff onboard, continuing operation processes, and meeting financial goals. While many women-led business funding programs often focus on STEM support, women-owned organizations are much more prevalent in retail, accommodation, food services, and tourism. Despite these new and ongoing challenges, women entrepreneurs remain one of the fastest growing business segments in Canada. Women-led businesses create new jobs four times faster than the national average. Women create companies at double the national average. The number of women with incorporated businesses has more than doubled in the past decade. To continue this accelerated growth, women entrepreneurs must remain competitive. We\u2019ve outlined three financial resources available across Canada that are developed specifically to assist women in starting, planning, and building a successful small business. BMO for Women: Committed to Real Financial Progress (https://bmoforwomen.com/) BMO has released statistics showcasing that despite the ongoing battle against changing the status quo of the business world, 57% of women still wish they were more confident in their financial decision making. With over 3,000 members, the BMO Alliance for Women (https://bmoforwomen.com/) is a community of employees \u2014 of all genders \u2014 who champion the inclusion, connection, development, advancement, and support of women. BMO for Women provides educational resources, funding opportunities, shared networking, and guidelines for women in business all across the country. RBC\u2019s Women Entrepreneur Support for Small Business (https://www.rbcroyalbank.com/business/advice/index.html?utm_source=redirect&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=bfs_srvr_redirect?source=%20site_smallbusiness_en) The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (https://www.rbcroyalbank.com/business/advice/starting-a-business-v2.html) has specifically developed advice and services to meet the needs of women entrepreneurs. Financing is available through the bank, as well as additional resources and expertise. Through their Small Business Financial Services Resource Centre (https://www.rbcroyalbank.com/business/advice/index.html?utm_source=redirect&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=bfs_srvr_redirect?source=%20site_smallbusiness_en) , women entrepreneurs can access a wide variety of information and assistance in starting and expanding a business, as well as succession planning for their retirement. They also provide one-on-one strategic advising for women entrepreneurs to ensure that their businesses are successful. RBC has also developed the RBC Canadian Women Entrepreneur Awards (https://www.womenofinfluence.ca/rbc-cwea/) , allowing female entrepreneurs to celebrate one another and network side by side. By celebrating women entrepreneurs, RBC hopes to provide significant profile of the importance of female business-owners to the Canadian economy. The Scotiabank Women Initiative: Supporting Women-Led Businesses (https://www.scotiabank.com/women-initiative/ca/en.html) The Scotiabank Women Initiative (https://www.scotiabank.com/women-initiative/ca/en/about-us.html) is a comprehensive program helping women take their businesses to the next level, through access to capital funding, mentorship, and education. When signed up for the program, members will benefit from small group mentoring sessions on pre-defined topics hosted by the experienced Advisory Board to discuss complex business issues and help women grow their businesses. The initiative works individually with each unique women-led business to develop tailored solutions in accessing funding to preserve and increase cash flow. The Forum Founder\u2019s Circle by The Toronto-Dominion (TD) Bank In association with TD Bank, The Forum Founder\u2019s Circle (https://www.theforum.ca/founders-circle) hosts a five-month long program (https://theforum.formstack.com/forms/founderscircle2024?_ga=2.7708209.2072151363.1703108448-1548725414.1703108448) designed to support women entrepreneurs. By joining this program, members will access five 2-hour long sessions over the course of five months to: Access a deeply supportive community of peers and specialized experts who will advise and support you during and after the program; Find solutions to business challenges with entrepreneurs and experienced advisors who understand your needs; Build a growth plan that addresses key opportunities and challenges, and identify a strategy to achieve these goals; Be equipped with tangible tools to unlock your next phase of growth; and Learn about topics related to optimizing cash flow, planning personal and business wealth, tax planning, and team expansion. The virtual kickoff for this program begins on January 31, 2024. Apply today (https://theforum.formstack.com/forms/founderscircle2024?_ga=2.7708209.2072151363.1703108448-1548725414.1703108448) to save your seat. Government Funding Programs for Women-Led Businesses There are also several current government funding programs that cater to supporting women-led businesses, such as the Canada Summer Jobs (CSJ) (https://www.mentorworks.ca/government-funding/human-resources-and-training/canada-summer-jobs/) and the (https://www.mentorworks.ca/government-funding/human-resources-and-training/skills-development-fund/) Skills Development Fund (SDF) by helping women grow their businesses with access to grants for hiring and training opportunities. In order to remain vigilant, women entrepreneurs require ongoing access to up-to-date information and resources.

I have had this light bulb of an idea come to me for a nail product paired with technology and I have had it hidden away for 4 years so far to long, I need to get this out there, but have to do it the right way and can NOT trust anyone cause they will steal my idea, especially if they have money!!!!!!!!! I am looking to get my invention patented and need financial assistance to accomplish that. I have an absolutely revolutionary invention regarding nails that is not on the market but once it hits it would be a gold mine!!!! I am looking to pitch this idea to all the big cosmetic companies such as, Cover Girl, Revlon, L\u2019Or\u00e9al , Maybelline. I also know once they hear this pitch for this nail product they will be competing for who gets the deal because it will change the way ladies apply color on their nails which has never been on the market since the invention of wet nail color!!! Please give me some information on how to proceed!!!!!! Thanks .comment-content Reply (#comment-354) .comment-body Jeff Shepherd (https://www.mentorworks.ca) says: .comment-author January 17, 2019 at 7:15 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta Hi Nicole, thanks for your message. At this time, you and your innovative idea are not well-suited for government funding programs. Government grants and loans typically support the research, development, commercialization, and manufacturing of products. Funding to offset the costs of patents is not provided at the government level, however, the cost of registering a patent in Canada is not very expensive. Here\u2019s some information on patents (http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/wr00142.html) from the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. Government funding is ideal for established companies that have at least two years of positive financial statements, two or more employees, and are incorporated. Until you can satisfy these requirements, you do not have much funding potential and Mentor Works is of limited help. Hopefully the resource linked above sends you on the right path! .comment-content Reply (#comment-355) .comment-body #comment-## .children #comment-## Annie Kashamura Zawadi says: .comment-author March 4, 2019 at 6:57 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta Hi Jeff, I am starting a training organization responding to the need of training corporate businesses in Gender Equality, Sexual Harassment, Gender Based Violence, Anti-Discrimination and the likes. Could you kindly guide me in terms of available grants/funds. Best regards, Annie .comment-content Reply (#comment-380) .comment-body Jeff Shepherd (https://www.mentorworks.ca) says: .comment-author March 5, 2019 at 2:58 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta Hi Annie, thanks for your comment! In terms of starting your training organization, there are no government funding programs we track that could assist you. The vast majority of government funding programs available assist mature, growth-oriented businesses to expand and become more successful. Companies with a limited track record of profitability are generally not considered for government grants. One program you should be aware of, however, is the Canada Job Grant (CJG) (/what-we-offer/government-funding/human-resources-and-training/canada-job-grant-cjg/) , a program which can help your customers offset training costs by up to $10,000 per trainee. This reduces the cost of your training to the client and improves their ROI, leading to happier clients that are willing to provide workforce training more often. Something to look into when you\u2019re up and running! .comment-content Reply (#comment-383) .comment-body #comment-## .children #comment-## Cathy Radies says: .comment-author June 5, 2019 at 7:33 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta I am interested in starting a facility to take in abused horses and stop them from being sent to slaughter. I am an approved BC SPCA handler/care giver and transporter. This business would involve not just bringing the animal backup to proper health but to spend time with them to allow them to be at a state of being available for adoption to private individuals who would keep them and not just send them to auctions to be sold for horse meat. I am wanting to know what is available for grants or loans to do up this type of start up business which would also employ other people than just myself. Pls advise if there are any options available to me. .comment-content Reply (#comment-422) .comment-body Jeff Shepherd (https://www.mentorworks.ca) says: .comment-author June 10, 2019 at 3:28 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta Hi Cathy, thanks for your message. At this time, I believe the best option to support your business is the Canada Small Business Financing Program (CSBFP) (https://www.mentorworks.ca/what-we-offer/government-funding/business-expansion/canada-small-business-financing-program/) , a government funding program designed to ease the process of accessing bank or credit union loans. Most government government grants and loans are targeted towards established companies that are looking to invest hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Until you\u2019re ready to complete projects of this size, CSBFP is your best bet! .comment-content Reply (#comment-423) .comment-body #comment-## .children #comment-## Hardeep Olak says: .comment-author August 13, 2019 at 5:57 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta Good Morning my name is Hardeep Olak, I want to know where to find funding for starting a development business in building affordable homes in rural communities and where the customers are.
